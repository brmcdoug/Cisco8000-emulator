*instructions assume containerlab or other orchestrator of dockerized router images is already installed*

1. load dockerized 8201 image:
```
docker load -i 8201-32fh_clab293_latest.tar.gz 
```

2. clone/download this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/brmcdoug/Cisco8000-emulator.git
```

3. cd into the repo directory and deploy topology
```
sudo containerlab deploy -t 4-node-clab.yaml 
```

Output should look something like
```
brmcdoug@naja:~/Cisco8000-emulator$ sudo containerlab deploy -t 4-node-clab.yaml

```

4. routers take a few minutes to build/boot. use docker logs command to monitor progress
```
docker logs -f clab-clab8000e-leaf1 
```

Eventually routers should come up and tail of docker logs looks like
```
18:45:05 INFO R0:applying XR config
18:45:08 INFO Sim up
Router up

^C
```

5. routers should be reachable via ssh to mgt IP - see config directory
```
ssh cisco@192.168.124.100
```

6. if for some reason routers are not reachable via ssh/ping try accessing console to troubleshoot
```
docker exec -it clab-clab8000e-leaf1  telnet 0 60000
```
